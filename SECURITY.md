# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As the Ziv programming language is in its early stages of development, we do not have official versions yet. However, we take security seriously from the start and encourage contributors and users to report any security vulnerabilities through GitHub's **Security Advisory** feature.

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately using the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature by following these steps:

1. Go to the Ziv repository.
2. Click on the "Security" tab.
3. Select "Report a vulnerability."
4. Provide a detailed description of the issue, including:
   - **Description of the vulnerability**: A clear explanation of the issue.
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Instructions or code snippets that help us reproduce the problem.
   - **Potential impact**: How the issue could affect users or systems.
   - **Suggested fix (optional)**: If you have any ideas for fixing the vulnerability, please include them.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**. We will work with you to investigate the issue, identify a resolution, and plan an appropriate timeline for addressing it.

### Disclosure Process

- We kindly request that you **do not publicly disclose** any vulnerabilities until we have had the opportunity to address them. Publicly sharing the vulnerability before a fix can expose users to unnecessary risks.
- Once the issue is resolved, a detailed security advisory will be published, and all users will be encouraged to update their repositories accordingly.


We greatly appreciate your efforts to help keep Ziv secure!
